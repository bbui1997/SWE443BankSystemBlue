Title: Create object diagram drafts

Description:
Split into a few task forces and create object diagrams for each of the completed scenarios. 
After creating the object diagrams, begin drafting class diagrams. 
These diagrams can be early sketches/drafts. Use this time to brainstorm. 
Make sure to follow all of the usual class and object diagram syntax/structure. 
Create the diagrams either by hand or with your favorite UML tool/powerpoint. 
Upload diagrams to the group Google Drive in the appropriate folder. Make sure your diagrams are clearly titled. 

Time estimate: 
~2 classes (roughly 2.5 hours)
