PUT ALL BUGS/FIXES NEEDED TO BE DEALT WITH FROM CODE FROM ITERATION 1 HERE!
FOR EVERY BUG FOUND HERE, WRITE A TEST AND THEN IMPLEMENT YOUR SOLUTION IF YOU CHOOSE TO WORK ON IT
Create Account
 - Name: Multiple accounts
   Assigned:
   When you create multiple accounts with the same username with different passwords,
   you can no longer log in to that account. It just states you have the wrong password.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Don't allow multiple accounts with the same username

 - Name: Enforce DOB Length
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can currently input "1" when inputting their DOB. Enforce the MMDDYYYY format.
   Priority: Low
   Potential Fix: Use regex to enforce this. This may possibly be fixed later when we implement
                  it with Android/Web GUI since there are ways to enforce Date.

 - Name: Enforce 4 ints of SSN
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can input any int as their SSN. Enforce them to the last 4 ints of their SSN (or 4 ints).
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: A method isValidSSN() would probably be a good idea, and check 1000 <= x <= 9999.
 
 - Name: Error handling for SSN
   Assigned:
   If a user enters a len 4 String for SSN, the program will crash. Force them to try to re-enter if this happens.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: A try/catch block would probably suffice.

Withdraw
 - Name: Ensure double input on withdraw
   Assigned:
   A user can input any random value for when they are asked how much they want to withdraw (like a string).
   This causes an error and crashes the program.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a double. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this already, so we might not need to fix this yet.

 - Name: Withdraw negative value, gains money
   Assigned:
   A user can input a negative value when they withdraw, which would make them gain money. This shouldn't
   be possible.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Use an if-statement to check if it's a negative value and tell them to try again.

 - Name: Possibly allow more values to withdraw?
   Assigned:
   Currently, a user is only allowed to withdraw 100, 20, or 10. Brandon believes that they should be able
   to withdraw more values
   Priority: Unsure
   Potential Fix: Use conditional statements to check the amount to be withdrawn.

Deposit
 - Name: Ensure double input on deposit
   Assigned:
   A user can input any random value for when they are asked how much they want to deposit (like a string).
   This causes an error and crashes the program.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a double. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this already, so we might not need to fix this yet.
 
 - Name: Negative deposit
   Assigned:
   When a user inputs a negative value when depositing, it will throw an illegal argument exception.
   This is the correct exception to throw, but when we are actually using the program, we probably don't
   want it to crash.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block for the IAS. Make them try again.

Transfer
  - Name: Need to implement it to be used in the main menu
    Assigned:
    As of right now, transfer is working as it should. If you put in a double and Account as parameters, it will transfer the money over to that
	account. Currently, however, if we try to transfer from the main menu, it will throw a NullPointerException. We need to probably
	write better scenarios or consult with the Mockups in order to get a better idea for implementation.
	Priority: High
	Potential Fix: We have to wait until we're sure about how to implement it...

Welcome Screen
 - Name: Invalid menu value
   Assigned:
   If a user inputs a String value on the menu screen, it will crash the program.
   Priority: Low
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a valid input. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this later on, so we might not need to fix this.

FOR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TESTS
 - Name: Add second object diagram and format tests to create a meaningful storyboard (Example: Found in TransferTests/testTransferScenario1)
   Assigned:
   A single object diagram is meaningless. There's almost no reason to have only the result of the object diagram be shown in the storyboard.
   It needs to include the initial scenario, and then at least the end result. If there are multiple steps, such as the undo tests, there should be more.
   Fix these tests:
     - ModifyTransactionTests/testModifyTransactionUndoDeposit
	 - ModifyTransactionTests/testModifyTransactionUndoWithdraw
	 - ModifyTransactionTests/testModifyTransactionUndoTransfer
	 - TransactionTests/testDepositScenario1
	 - TransactionTests/testDepositScenario2
	 - TransactionTests/testDepositScenario3
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Have more than 1 storyboard.addObjectDiagram(...)'s. One at the very start of the test, and another storyboard for every 
                  action that changes the state of that object we were looking at.

Account initialAmount
  - Name: Get rid of initialAmount and safely refactor
    Assigned:
    There's almost no reason to have this variable in our Account class. No one will care about the initialAmount you put in the Account.
	They will just check the balance.
	Priority: Low
	Potential Fix: Get rid of it and refactor methods and tests that use it. IntelliJ has a good feature that allows you to check where it has
	               been used in your project.
