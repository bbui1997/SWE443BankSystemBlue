PUT ALL BUGS/FIXES NEEDED TO BE DEALT WITH FROM CODE FROM ITERATION 1 HERE!
FOR EVERY BUG FOUND HERE, WRITE A TEST AND THEN IMPLEMENT YOUR SOLUTION IF YOU CHOOSE TO WORK ON IT
Create Account
 - Name: Multiple accounts
   Assigned:
   When you create multiple accounts with the same username with different passwords,
   you can no longer log in to that account. It just states you have the wrong password.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Don't allow multiple accounts with the same username

 - Name: Create Account, nonsense name
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can add nonsensical values as a name (numbers and symbols in a name). Keep it to 
   letters and possibly -s and 's.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use regex to enforce this.

 - Name: Enforce DOB Length
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can currently input "1" when inputting their DOB. Enforce the MMDDYYYY format.
   Priority: Low
   Potential Fix: Use regex to enforce this. This may possibly be fixed later when we implement
                  it with Android/Web GUI since there are ways to enforce Date.

 - Name: Enforce 8 len password
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can currently have a 1 char password. This isn't very safe. Enforce the minimum password
   length to be 8 chars.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use an if-statement to check length.

 - Name: Enforce 4 ints of SSN
   Assigned: Marcus/Salonika
   A user can input any int as their SSN. Enforce them to the last 4 ints of their SSN (or 4 ints).
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: A method isValidSSN() would probably be a good idea, and check 1000 <= x <= 9999.

Withdraw
 - Name: Ensure double input on withdraw
   Assigned:
   A user can input any random value for when they are asked how much they want to withdraw (like a string).
   This causes an error and crashes the program.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a double. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this already, so we might not need to fix this yet.

 - Name: Withdraw negative value, gains money
   Assigned:
   A user can input a negative value when they withdraw, which would make them gain money. This shouldn't
   be possible.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Use an if-statement to check if it's a negative value and tell them to try again.

 - Name: Possibly allow more values to withdraw?
   Assigned:
   Currently, a user is only allowed to withdraw 100, 20, or 10. Brandon believes that they should be able
   to withdraw more values
   Priority: Unsure
   Potential Fix: Use conditional statements to check the amount to be withdrawn.

Deposit
 - Name: Ensure double input on deposit
   Assigned:
   A user can input any random value for when they are asked how much they want to deposit (like a string).
   This causes an error and crashes the program.
   Priority: Medium
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a double. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this already, so we might not need to fix this yet.
 
 - Name: Negative deposit
   Assigned:
   When a user inputs a negative value when depositing, it will throw an illegal argument exception.
   This is the correct exception to throw, but when we are actually using the program, we probably don't
   want it to crash.
   Priority: High
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block for the IAS. Make them try again.

Welcome Screen
 - Name: Invalid menu value
   If a user inputs a String value on the menu screen, it will crash the program.
   Priority: Low
   Potential Fix: Use a try/catch block to make sure they enter a valid input. There's a possiblity that the
                  the UI from Android/Web will enforce this later on, so we might not need to fix this.
