## Bug Reports
With every iteration comes new bugs.
This directory is used to track each new bug that have been found by either <br>
the leaders or other developers when testing the code. <br>
The developers can freely take on each bug as long as they notify <br>
the group on Slack to avoid merge conflicts.
