Title: Basic Android Gui

Description: Using the mockups created last week, begin a basic implementation of an Android GUI for the BlueBank System.
The app only needs to be functional. Usability and clean up will come in later weeks. The app needs to: 
-login (if possible with persistence) 
-create an account
-deposit money
-withdraw money
-transfer money
-modify a transaction

Time estimate(s):
2-3h + 10 hrs = 13 hours
