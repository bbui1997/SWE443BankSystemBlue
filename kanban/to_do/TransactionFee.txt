Title: Transaction Fee

 Transaction Fee functionality should be implemented for withdraw/deposit/modify/transfer. It should take in an amount to be withdrawn/deposited/etc and a percentage of fee to be taken out. The fee percentage can be assigned arbitrarily by the developer. 
 Tests need to be written for this functionality as well.
