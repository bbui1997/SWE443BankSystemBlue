Title: Stub Transaction Class and create sequence diagrams for scenarios

Description of Transaction class:

Attributes:
- big int amount - value of transaction
- enum type - withdraw, deposit, transfer
- boolean isMain -
- boolean isFee -
- boolean isCorrection -
* any transaction must have exactly one boolean value==true.

Methods:
- logBuilder - builds the line to store this transaction into the account holder’s log file.
* Right now we are focusing on the Transaction class and how it relates with itself and Account class. So don’t worry too much about the method(s).

Self Relationships:
- corresponds. Cardinality 1-1
	- One transaction can correspond to another in two ways: one fee transaction corresponds to one *main* deposit/withdraw/transfer transaction (D/W/T). One *main* D/W/T transaction corresponds to its *corrected* D/W/T transaction (* Note that corrected transactions may not necessarily be of the same type).
	- So every transaction always corresponds to at least one transaction (its fee transaction). But can also correspond with its correction.
- before and after. Cardinality 1-1
	- This relationship right now does not matter. We’ll come back to this.

Relationships between Transaction and Account:
- from. Cardinality n to 0…1
- to. Cardinality n to 0…1
- explanation of n to 0…1:
	- Transaction transfer: Ash’s account transfers $100 to Jess’s account. Transaction transfer has one “to” relationship with Account Ash. Transaction transfer has one “from” relationship with Account Jess
	- Transaction withdraw: Ash’s account withdraws $100. Transaction withdraw has zero “to” relationships with Account Ash. Transaction withdraw has one “from” relationship with Account Ash
	- Transaction deposit: Ash’s account has a deposit of $100. Transaction deposit has one “to” relationship with Account Ash. Transaction deposit has zero “from” relationships with Account Ash.
