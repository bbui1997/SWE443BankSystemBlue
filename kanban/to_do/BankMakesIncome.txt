Title: Bank Entity Makes Money

Description:
The bank needs to be able to make money off of its customers. After the transaction fee functionality is implemented, the bank should retain a running total of income that it has made off of all the fees it charges to its users. This running total should be a singular pool so that it does not matter who's account the fee was taken from.
Tests need to be written for this functionality as well.
Object diagrams need to be created for these tests
