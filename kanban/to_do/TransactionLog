Title: Implement functionality to log transactions of each user/account

Description of new functionality (transaction log):

  - As soon as a new account is created, a text file "username.txt" should be created in the test folder.
  - The log should consist of the initial balance as the first line.
  - The following lines should represent any withdraws, deposits, transfers made by that account
  - If a transaction was modified then those lines should be modified or removed from the log.
  - There is a new feature of a "transaction fee" that may be charged for withdraw, deposit, transfer or modify.
    These fees should also appear in the log

Related scenario(s):

  - ModifyTransaction, DepositMoney, WithdrawMoney, TransferMoney

Time estimate(s):

  2h - create scenarios/object diagrams
  3h - write tests and stub class
  3h - implement functions needed for functionality
