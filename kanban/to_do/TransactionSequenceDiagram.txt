Title: Transaction Class Sequence Diagram

Description: In order to depict the way a Transaction moves through the BlueBank system, a Sequence Diagram will need to be created. 
If you are unsure as to how to create a sequence diagram, Google has tons of resources. Also, feel free to reach out to Jess for help 
with this task. The diagram should depict the entire life cycle of a transaction (start to finish). Remember that sequence diagrams are 
ordered (cascade from top to bottom). Use any tool you're comfortable with.
