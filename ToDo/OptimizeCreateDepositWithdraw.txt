Title: Optimize Create Account, Deposit, Withdraw

Description:
Now that Create, Deposit, and Withdraw are bug free, there is some optimization to be done: 
Name: User should not be able to add nonsensical values as a name (such as numbers)
SSN: standardize this to the last 4 digits of user's SSN. Enforce the standard
DOB: Enforce the MMDDYYYY format. Currently a user can input "1"
Password: Enforce a password length. (Typically the minimum password should be 8-16 chars)
Do not allow negative balance for withdraw.

Time estimate: 
~1.5 hours
