Title: User Sal successfully undoes her recent Transfer.

Scenario 1:
  - Sal has exactly followed the steps in the TRANSFER_MONEY Scenario1.
  - She has successfully transferred $100 from her account to Sara's account.
  - She immediately realizes that she has already paid Sara in cash, and does not need to transfer her money.
  - She chooses to undo her recent transaction at the prompt.
  - The ATM automatically deducts $100 from Sara's account and puts it back into Sal's account.
  - Since the rollback was successful, the ATM prompts Sal with the initial screen and asks her what to do.
  - Sal chooses to print a receipt and exit the ATM.
  - The receipt shows her initial balance, transfer amount to sara's account, cancellation of the transfer, and the
    new balance (which is equal to the initial balance).
